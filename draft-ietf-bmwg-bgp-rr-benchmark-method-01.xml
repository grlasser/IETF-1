      <t>BGP is commonly used with network operators in order to distribute routing information for both infrastructure routes as well as service routing information.  BGP is used due to its ability to handle high amounts of prefix and path information coupled with additional administrative information, such as communities, in a very scalable and stable manner.  Due to the way iBGP operates it is either necessary to deploy routers in a full iBGP mesh configuration or to introduce a administrative point(s) to distribute the routing information around the network.  These administrative reference points are call Route-Reflectors.  Route-Reflectors have be used for many years, however, with the advent of new technologies such as virtualisation there is a need to be able to benchmark this function is a consistent manner.  This document covers how to provide an accurate BGP route-reflector benchmark.</t>

      <section title="Issues to consider when testing">
      <t>
      	BGP is a protocol based on TCP.  As such it uses the inherent features available in TCP to ensure transmission of information such as TCP window sizing.  The understanding of this is important when creating a testing setup and methodology which accurately tests the DUT as opposed to being hampered by any limitations in testing equipment or other underlying protocols.

In order to ensure that TCP windowing does not adversely effect the distribution of BGP routing update information during the test it is necessary to ensure that adequate physical bandwidth is available between the tester devices and the DUT.  This should be achieved through the provision of 5 x 10 GigabitEthernet interfaces between Tester 1 and the DUT and 5 x 10 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces between Tester 2 and the DUT.  This will remove the chance for there to be a bandwidth bottleneck when advertising multiple BGP updates simultaneously.

The IP MTU value on all interfaces between the DUT and the testers should be set to 9000 bytes to ensure consistency in results.

Another important consideration is the behaviour of any testing devices being utilised to obtain the benchmarking figures.  In order to provide clear and unambiguous guideance this document will detail the requirements on the testing devices as well.

</t>
<t>Test devices should be able to support the following features:

<list style="symbols">
          <t>The ability to bring multiple BGP peering sessions into an ESTABLISHED state without advertising any prefix/path information</t>

          <t>The ability to advertise all BGP prefix/path information immediately and simultaneously without grouping advertisements into smaller sections of ramping up the advertisements over time.</t>
          <t>The ability to count the number of prefixes advertised.</t>
          <t>The ability to count the number of prefixes received.  Best-path processing or FIB installation are not required on the tester devices.</t>
          <t>The ability to start the test when the prefixes are advertised and to end the test when all prefixes are received, providing a time between these two points.</t>
        </list> 
</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Route Profiles">
      <t>
The profile of the routing information that is used may result in wildly different results depending on the Route-Reflectors internal implementations of the BGP protocol.  In order to provide meaningful results that can be used for accurate benchmarking of Route-Reflector implementations against one and other and to provide results capable of relating to real world deployments of the DUT there are a number of specific route profiles that should be tested.

Broadly these profiles fall into two categories.  

<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Synthetic Prefixes"><vspace blankLines="0" />Those generated according to an algorithm within the tester in a linear fashion where this is a bounded set of 100,000 prefixes.  The prefixes should be in the following distribution; for IPv4, 1,000 x /8, 10,000 x /16, 39,000 x /19, 50,000 x /24 .  For IPv6, DISTRIBUTION HERE.  Each prefix should contain 2 ASNs in the AS_PATH.  50% of the prefixes should rely on the same next-hop IP address and the remaining 50% should have a unique next-hop IP address.  Each prefix should contain two BGP community values.</t>

<t hangText="Global Internet Table"><vspace blankLines="0" />A 'recording' of the current Global Internet Routing table should be played back as the source feed providing a realistic prefix distribution, AS_PATH distribution, a realistic next-hop distribution and a realistic number of communities per prefix.  It is expected that this sample-set will change with each test as the Global Internet Table will change, however, the same sample-set must be used for every route-reflector taking part in a comparative benchmarking activity.</t>
</list>

        into HTML output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the
        text and nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details). It also
        has a "type" attribute. This is currently ignored except in the case
        'type="abnf"'. In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
        piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar. This will
        be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal error
        if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes". The ABNF will
        also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
        components. Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
        versions of xml2rfc.</preamble>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
